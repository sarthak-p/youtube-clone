## Objective:

### `LIVE DEMO`

## Local setup:
- Check that you have Node installed using command `node -v`.
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.

At this point, a new tab will be opened in your browser through which you can view/edit the app. You can type something in the searchbar and click the search icon which will take you to a preset search page. To go back to the homepage, click on the YouTube logo at the top.
